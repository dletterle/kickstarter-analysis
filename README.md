# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
Data was downloaded and properly saved in Excel
Rows,columns, sheet names and data type were appropriately noted
A pane was created with the first three columns and title row 
Conditional rules were created to show "successful" outcomes in green; "failed" outcomes in red; "live" outcomes in blue; and "canceled" outcomes in yello
Error donations were changed to "0" due to the fact that numbers cannot be divided by zero 
Pivot tables were created for categories and subcategories with the graphs:
